# Realtime-Payload-Based-IDS
Explanation and Implementation for RePIDS Models given by Aruna Jamdagni
This model uses three tier iterative feature selection engine for web payload analysis
Iterative feature selection engine utilizes Principle Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction
Reduced features can then be used in MD mappings for more accurate and realtime results

## Description:
* N-gram text categorization
* PCA Analysis and feature selection
* MDM Profile generation
